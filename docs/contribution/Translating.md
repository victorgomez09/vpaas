## Helping with Translations

All interface translations can be found inside the folder:

üìÅ `apps/ui/src/lib/locales`

> The base and fallback language is üá¨üáß `en`.

---

## üñêÔ∏è Manual First steps

To start translating to a new language:

1. create `apps/ui/src/lib/locales/jp.json` (change `jp` to chosen language)
2. copy the contents from `apps/ui/src/lib/locales/en.json` to your new json.
2. edit `apps/ui/src/lib/translations.ts`
* 2.1. add `jp: { lang },` inside `translations:`
* 2.2. duplicate the full `en` locale hash inside `loaders:`, change `en` to `jp`(chosen locale)

Congratulations! You are now ready to start translating

## ü§ñ Automated First Steps

We can ease the translation using [MoloLab Json Translator](https://github.com/mololab/json-translator):

```sh
# Install Json Tranlator
npm i -g @parvineyvazov/json-translator
# Run this command to create a new translation:
jsontt apps/ui/src/lib/locales/en.json

# Example Result:
jsontt apps/ui/src/lib/locales/en.json
? From which source? #ArgosTranslate
? From which language? #Automatic
? To which language | languages? #Spanish
‚úî DONE! 287 of 287 translated.
 All files are created! 
 You can find them in the same folder as the original JSON file. 
 For Spanish --> es.json created. 
```

## Currently supported locales

- [x] en
- [x] fr
- [x] pt (autogenerated - needs review)
- [x] es (autogenerated - needs review)
- [x] ko (autogenerated - needs review)

## ‚òëÔ∏è Todo:

- [ ] Write a script to 
  - sync missing keys from `en` to other locales;
  - remove deprecated keys from all non `en` locales;

- [ ] Sveltekit-i18n instructs to create one locale file per path, maybe we should review that soon.

- [ ] Improve the aesthetics of `<LocalePicker/>`
- [ ] Make selected locale persistent (in session or cookie)
