### Local Machine

At the moment, Coolify `doesn't support Windows`. 

You must use `Linux` or `MacOS` or consider using Gitpod or Github Codespaces.

Install all the prerequisites manually to your host system. 
If you would not like to install anything, 
I suggest to use the [container based development flow](#container-based-development-flow-easiest).

- Due to the lock file, this repository is best with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). I recommend you try and use `pnpm` because it is cool and efficient!
- You need to have [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed locally.
- You need to have [Docker Compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-plugin/) installed locally.
- You need to have [GIT LFS Support](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed locally.

Optional:
- To test Heroku buildpacks, you need [pack](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack) binary installed locally.
